# 🔧 404 Error Fix

## Issue
Getting `404: NOT_FOUND` error on deployment.

## Root Cause
Next.js was trying to statically generate pages that need dynamic rendering (client-side session checks, API calls).

## Fix Applied

1. **Added dynamic rendering to API route** (`app/api/games/route.js`):
   ```javascript
   export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';
   ```

2. **Added dynamic rendering to page** (`app/page.jsx`):
   ```javascript
   export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';
   ```

3. **Removed incorrect config** (`next.config.js`):
   - Removed `output: 'standalone'` (not needed for Vercel)

## Why This Works

- `force-dynamic` tells Next.js to always render these routes dynamically
- Prevents static generation attempts that cause 404s
- Required for routes that use:
  - `useSession()` hook
  - Server-side authentication
  - Dynamic API calls

## Next Steps

1. Wait for new deployment (automatic after push)
2. Check deployment status in Vercel dashboard
3. Access production URL: `https://ludex-davids-projects-794668e3.vercel.app`
4. Should now load correctly without 404

## Verification

After deployment, you should see:
- ✅ Page loads (no 404)
- ✅ Header with "🎲 Ludex"
- ✅ Authentication working
- ✅ Upload form (if signed in)
