# ✅ Fixed 404 Error

## Problem
You were getting a `404: NOT_FOUND` error because there was no Next.js app code deployed yet.

## Solution
I've created a basic Next.js app structure:

```
app/
├── layout.jsx      # Root layout
├── page.jsx        # Home page
└── globals.css     # Global styles
```

## What Was Created

1. **`app/layout.jsx`** - Root layout with metadata
2. **`app/page.jsx`** - Welcome/home page
3. **`app/globals.css`** - Basic global styles
4. **Updated `vercel.json`** - Added Next.js framework detection

## Next Steps

The changes have been committed and pushed. Vercel should automatically deploy:

1. **Wait for deployment** - Check your Vercel dashboard
2. **Visit your site** - The 404 should be gone!
3. **Start building** - Now you can add:
   - Authentication (NextAuth.js)
   - Upload form
   - Game library
   - API routes
   - etc.

## Verify Deployment

Check your Vercel dashboard:
- Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
- Click on your `ludex` project
- Check the latest deployment status
- Visit the deployment URL

The site should now show a welcome page instead of a 404 error! 🎉
